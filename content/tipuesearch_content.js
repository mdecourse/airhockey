Moreover, due to the rapid progress of Internet information technology, the impact of virtual and physical integration technology on product development becomes more common [19]. This paper developed an air hockey robot that can be played by human and computer program to use the image recognition to play the match. There are two major different type of air hockey game design, one use disk puck on an air cushion table and another use hover puck on any ordinary flat surface or table. In this research, hover puck design was chosen to allow air hockey robot to be attached to computer table of any size. This research is divided into four parts. The first step is to create a physical air hockey robot and use Python program for image recognition to allow the web camera to catch the position of the hover puck, and activate the two-degree-of-freedom motion of the mallet accordingly. The second step is to use CoppeliaSim [2] to simulate the mechatronic air hockey scene, and the third part is to use the Flow Simulation functions of Solidworks and COMSOL to analyze the air cushion dynamics of the fan blades inside the hover puck. In the end, the virtual and physical air hockey scene were streamed into the user web browser to allow multiple users to monitor or participate into the cyber-physical game. \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Introduction.html'}, {'title': 'Literature Review', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Literature Review.html'}, {'title': 'Design Process', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Design Process.html'}, {'title': 'Physical Design', 'text': 'Onshape Files: \n air hockey robot assembly \n \n In order to collaboratively design all parts of the X-Y table system to manipulate the planar motion of the mallet, the full cloud computer aided design system,  Onshape  was used. The motion control of the hockey mallet is implemented by using Arduino、 stepping motors and pulley-belt system to position the mallet. \n The designed air hockey  Onshape  assembly file can be accessed from. The mechatronic simulation of the air hockey machine is completed in  Coppeliasim . \n The design of the hover puck uses the air flow generated by the built-in fan to levitate from the platform to reduce the friction, so that it can move smoothly The control uses the Arduino circuit board to receive the binary data transmitted by the Python module Pyserial for corresponding control, so that the motor can move along X and Y coordinates. \n The air hockey robot completed in this research can be assembled on a common computer desk. The hover puck can float on the desk by the downward negative pressure driven by the fan. And the two-degree-of-freedom movement range of the X-Y Table can adapt to the size of the table. In achieving the levitation effect, the hover puck needs three AAA batteries, which are arranged into a triangular layout around the motor to achieve dynamic balance.', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Physical Design.html'}, {'title': 'Program Development', 'text': 'The image recognition program is written in Python combined with the OpenCV module, and interacts with the virtual environment through the remote api interface of Coppeliasim.
